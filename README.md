# Reaction-Bot

The source for a reaction bot made by me.

A simple python bot that will react to any sent messages in a channel you put using the emoji you would like. Pretty good for a fun channel or something to just annoy people when you run it.

Set up a discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications for the bot to work (This is the token you will be inputting)
